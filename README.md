This is a Fabric Minecraft mod that adds logic gates to the game. Logic gates are redstone components that can either output or not output redstone signal based on the redstone inputs. You can read more about logic gates and how they work here.  

# Features
#### Logic gates featured in this mod:
- AND gate
- NOT gate
- NAND gate
- OR gate
- NOR gate
- XOR gate
- XNOR gate
  
#### Latches featured in this mod:
- Set-Reset latch
- Data latch
  
#### Other redstone components featured in this mod:
- Wire (acts like a 0 tick repeater)
- Wire turn (same as wire, but it is a 90° turn)

# How to use the logic gates
Logic gates act similarly to repeaters, except as opposed to having one input and output, they have multiple inputs and one output. A logic gate's redstone output depends on it's redstone inputs. Most logic gates featured in this mod have two inputs and one output. Such logic gates have one input on the opposite side of the output, and one input on the side. You can toggle the direction of the side inputs of logic gates by right clicking (using) them.

# How to craft the logic gates
More info, including how logic gates work and how to craft them can be found on the Wiki page. They are simply too long to fit on this page.
